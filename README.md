# CS3310-Project-2
Java code for my CS3310 project 2
My code for this project consists of 3 separate java classes. One for Dijkstra's algorithm as a subroutine, one for FLoyd Warshall algorithm, 
and one maind driver class that uses function calls for both algorithms in order to perform what the project is asking for.

The dijkstra java class/file is for the Dijkstra's as a subroutine.
The fw java class/file is for the Floyd Warshall algorithm.
The pairs java class/file is for the main driver class that uses the other two.
